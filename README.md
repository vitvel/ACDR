Dispersion representation for analytically continued nested harmonic sums

This is the extended version of database and MATHEMATICA-code, which is used in the paper Velizhanin V.N. "Analytic continuation of harmonic sums: dispersion representation", https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15182.
Files DiffRootUpToW"i".m contain the linear difference equations for nested harmonic sums up to weight "i": up to weight 7 for all nested harmonic sums, up to weight 11 for all nested harmonic sums without index "-1".
Files ACtablePolesUpToW"i".m contain the pole expression for the analytically continued nested harmonic sums up to weight "i": up to weight 7 for all nested harmonic sums, up to weight 11 for all nested harmonic sums without index "-1".
File DispRepr.m contains MATHEMATICA-code with examples, which show, how to use these databases for the construction of the dispersion representation for the nested harmonic sums and its numerical evaluation.
The database for the pole expression for the analytically continued nested harmonic sums up to weight 13 can be found here: https://github.com/vitvel/ACHS
